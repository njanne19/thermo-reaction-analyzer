# Instructions on how to use the project

## Use the form: Products = Reactants <br> YOU MUST ADD a (form of matter) WITH EVERY COMPOUND (e.g. Fe(s))

Separate both sides within compounds with a "plus sign (+)". Include coefficients at the front of each compound. This project does not check for a balanced chemical equation.

This project is based off of two API's I created. They return JSON data and can be found here, and used on their own.
